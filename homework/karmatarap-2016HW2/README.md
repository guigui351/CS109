# HW2

This repository contains the HW2 assignment for BIO 260 and CSCI E-107 in Spring 2016.  

This homework is due Friday February 26, 2016 at 5:00 PM. When complete, submit your code in the R Markdown file and the knitted HTML via GitHub. The R Markdown file should be able to be knitted by the instructor or TA after it is submitted. 

**Remember** to use the basic `git` routine: 

1. Work on your homework
2. Add changes to track with: `git add`
3. Commit changes to your local repository: `git commit`
4. Push the changes to your github repo: `git push`

We will grade the last commit as your final submission before the deadline. The excuse of "I forgot to `push` my code" is **not** an acceptable excuse for late work.  

For help on cloning this repository, using the basic `git` routine or submitting your homework solutions by committing changes to this repository, see the [submitting-HW-using-git.Rmd](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2016/blob/master/lectures/git-and-github/submitting-HW-using-git.Rmd).
